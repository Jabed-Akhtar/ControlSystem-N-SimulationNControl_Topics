    "# Jacobian matrix\n",
    "The Jacobian matrix is a matrix of partial derivatives that describes how a set of functions change with respect to their variables. In the context of a dynamic system, particularly for stability analysis, the Jacobian matrix helps linearize the system around an equilibrium point. This linearization allows us to study the local behavior of the system near the equilibrium.  \n",
    "For a non-linear system represented by x_dot=f(x,u), where x is the state vector, u is the input vector, and x_dot is the vector of time derivatives, the Jacobian matrix is given by:  \n",
    "<img src=\"notebook_imgs/partial_derivative_fun.png\" alt=\"Example Image\" width=\"70\"/>  \n",
    "The Jacobian matrix A represents how small changes in the state variables x correspond to changes in the time derivatives x_dot. This is crucial for stability analysis, as it allows us to study the linearized system dynamics near an equilibrium point."
